      <p>In mathematics, the irrational numbers are all the real numbers which are not rational numbers, 
the latter being the numbers constructed from ratios (or fractions) of integers. 
When the ratio of lengths of two line segments is an irrational number, the line segments are also described as being incommensurable, 
meaning that they share no “measure” in common, that is, there is no length (“the measure”), no matter how short, 
that could be used to express the lengths of both of the two given segments as integer multiples of itself.</p>
